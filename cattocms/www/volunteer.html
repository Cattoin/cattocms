            <h3 >Why volunteer or why be a Sathi?</h3>
            <p>
                At Sampark Sathi, our volunteers are called "Sathis," which means a friend who is there for you when you need them. A Sathi is more than just a helper; they are a trusted companion dedicated to supporting beneficiaries in every step of their journey. Hereâ€™s how a Sathi makes a difference:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guidance and Support:</strong> Sathis help beneficiaries understand and gather all the necessary documents and information they need.</li>
                <li><strong>Accompaniment and Comfort:</strong> Sathis go with beneficiaries to visits, whether it's to an NGO, a government office, or a hospital, providing emotional support and making them feel comfortable.</li>
                <li><strong>Empowerment and Advocacy:</strong> By being there, Sathis empower beneficiaries to confidently seek and receive the help they need, turning scary situations into manageable ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Assistance:</strong> Each Sathi understands the unique needs of the beneficiary and provides tailored support, making sure every concern is addressed efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At Sampark Sathi, we believe everyone deserves a friend who stands by them in times of need. Our Sathis are that friend, dedicated to making a positive impact in the lives of those they serve.
