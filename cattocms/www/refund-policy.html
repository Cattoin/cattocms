        <p>
            Any contribution on the Sampark Sathi payment widget by an individual, is for a specific cause to a specific individual or a group and should not be construed as an investment in any form whatsoever. Sampark Sathi is not the final recipient of any funds from the contributors directly, but a service provider, which enables receipt of funds (Domestic) for individual or group beneficiary campaigns, who are the final recipient of fund. Sampark Sathi helps individuals or groups in collecting donations and donations cannot be refunded. Thus there is no refund or return policy. Donations by their very nature are non-refundable and the transaction is complete once the donation is made. Thus there is no delivery in this model.
