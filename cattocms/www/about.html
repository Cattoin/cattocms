                Prem Ashra, a dedicated social worker from Delhi School of Social Work, combines his knowledge of profession and power of passion to drive meaningful social change. During his time volunteering while earning his Master's in Social Work, he gained an in-depth understanding of various issues and firsthand experience of ground realities. He encountered numerous individuals facing significant challenges due to a lack of access to essential services. Although he was eager to assist, the organization he was with focused solely on education, which limited his ability to provide comprehensive support. This experience ignited his passion to address these gaps after graduation. With a solution-oriented mindset, he founded Sampark Sathi to bridge this divide and empower marginalized communities by connecting them with relevant NGOs. Prem views every issue through the lens of human rights and basic human dignity, regardless of a person's status in society. Consequently, he established a platform where people from all walks of life, whose voices often go unheard, can express their concerns not as a matter of charity, but as a matter of right.
