        A relentless sister held onto his little brother at the time of adversity and helped him get access to the best treatment possible.

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>Little Alok was diagnosed with epilepsy. He had seizure attacks thrice within a span of six months. The family did not have enough to spend on his treatment. Several hospitals have turned their back stating no bed or treatment for this poor kid. One hospital asked for the MRI which was something his family could not afford. And the treatment was impossible without the report. Even the medicines prescribed were out of stock in the Government Hospitals. It was his persistent sister Jyoti who reached out to Sampark Sathi Foundation. When the organisation got to know about the situation, Afham, our Sathi went for the preliminary verification.
        After the verification, our partner, Sapna NGO took care of the case and now he is getting every possible help which the child was not getting. Alok is recovering in a right way and we are thankful to our partner ngo for helping Alok in getting access to better healthcare facilities.

      Assistance by Afham (beneficiary's Sathi) made Kamal Ji get access to the right pair of prosthetics, which helps him walk independently.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>While the world was in the grips of a deadly virus, Kamal Ji was fighting his own battle. Losing a leg to a deadly infection during that time meant settling for a prosthetic leg beyond his capacity. Living in Jhuggi, Jahangirpuri, Kamal ji was grateful for the prosthetic leg he received from an NGO during a time when it would have been impossible to receive any treatment. But the prosthetic limb proved to be more trouble than assistance.Lifting an 8-kg prosthetic limb was taking a toll on him. This made him reach out to the Sampark Sathi Foundation. Our Sathi Afham assisted him in finding a leg that he was comfortable with, along with advanced features to make his life a little easier.Looking at his new prosthetic leg, he was grateful and full of praise for the Afham and Sampark Sathi Foundation.
      “ I am extremely happy that I could contribute a little to Kamal Ji's happiness. It felt great to help someone in need. Working with the Sampark Sathi Foundation has been an enriching experience for me, and I have acquired great skills.”
